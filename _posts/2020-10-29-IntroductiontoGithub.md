This is my first post in Github, so I thought I would take the time to introduce myself. 

I am currently a research analyst focused in the trucking industry, but I would like to expand my horizons by going to graduate school in economics. I currently work in R, but am also taking the time to learn Python so I can be an ideal candidate for graduate school. This profile is the first step in my journey. 

In addition to working with coding ability, I am also interested in statistical methods and always on the hunt for new packages in R and Stata.
