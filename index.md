# Growth Mindset

My name is Nathan Williams, an aspiring PhD student in Economics focused in Economic History, Industrial Organization, and Macroeconomics. I am fascinated by new statistical methods, as well as new coding techniques. 

I can code in R and Stata, but I am moving into Python as well.
